# GitHub Profile Card
GitHub Profile Card Application is developed in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) is used as React UI framework. I have used [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to make HTTP Request to Github API. In this application we need to enter ```GitHub username``` and we will get github profile of that user. If user does not exist, it will return 404 status code response.
